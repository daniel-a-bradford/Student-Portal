# Student-Portal
A Claim Academy class lab simulating a student portal. This is a proof of concept, rather than a full project with plenty of room for improvement.
Uses a Java SpringBoot backend with MySQL database to store student information. The front end is made with React. Student passwords are stored in an encrypted form.
